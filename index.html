    <h1>Sony confirmed the craziest ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ spoiler</h1>
    <img src="spiders.jpeg" alt="No way home" width="500" >
    <p>We knew well ahead of the Avengers: Endgame premiere that all the superheroes who died in that shocking Infinity War cliffhanger would be resurrected in the next Avengers movie. It made sense for the story, and Marvel’s MCU plans, to have those heroes return to life. In the year between the two stunning Avengers installments, we saw plenty of indirect evidence showing that the dead characters would reappear in Endgame. Yet Marvel kept insisting the deaths were final, and we needed to accept them.</p>
